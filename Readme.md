#### What is Typetron

**[Typetron](https://typetron.org)** is a **modern web framework** built for Node.js, written in **Typescript**, that
allows you to build fully featured web applications. What of the key differences of Typetron is that its core packages
were built from scratch in order to preserve the performance. (benchmark coming soon)
